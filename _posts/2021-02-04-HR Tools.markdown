description: I was subcontracted through SolutionsFBIA to build a custom HR database and reporting system in Microsoft Access for a client in the manufacturing industry. The database had multiple user functions, each user had their own password proctected account to limit access to only thier area. The database tracked employee records, employee appraisals, leave status and balances, disciplinary actions, and terminations. It also included a reporting interface to generate documentation for audit purposes.
