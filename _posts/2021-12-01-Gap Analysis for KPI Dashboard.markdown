description: I was contracted through SolutionsFBIA for requirements documentation and to provide a gap analysis for an orgainizational KPI dashboard for a 3rd party client. I documented the current and desired future state and pointed out any gaps between the two along with potential risks. I then included all of this information and proposed solutions for each data element.
